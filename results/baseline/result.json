As a result, when evaluating the transition rate, one must average over all possible directions of the electric field polarization.

In earlier lectures, we studied discrete transitions between atomic energy levels driven by a single harmonic perturbation. In thermal radiation, however, the electric field is not a single coherent wave but an incoherent superposition of many electromagnetic modes with different frequencies, amplitudes, and directions.\n\nEach mode of the radiation field can independently contribute to the transition probability. Because these contributions are incoherent, the probabilities must be summed rather than the amplitudes. This sum over discrete modes can be replaced by an integral over frequency, weighted by the energy density of the radiation field as a function of frequency.",

The rate depends on the strength of the electric field relative to the characteristic atomic electric field, and it decreases rapidly with increasing electron momentum. Although the photon frequency does not appear explicitly in the final expression, it enters implicitly through the momentum of the emitted electron.\n\nWe now shift focus to light interacting with atoms more generally. In the optical regime, the wavelength of light is much larger than the size of an atom, which allows us to neglect spatial variations of the electric field across the atom.

Selection rules determine when these matrix elements are nonzero. For electric dipole transitions, the change in the magnetic quantum number must be zero or plus or minus one, and the change in the orbital angular momentum quantum number must be plus or minus one.

The total transition probability is obtained by summing, or equivalently integrating, over all final states in the continuum. This introduces the density of states into the calculation.
